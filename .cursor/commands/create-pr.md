# Create PR

## Overview

Create a well-structured pull request with proper description, labels, and reviewers.

## Steps

1. **Prepare branch**
   - Ensure all changes are committed
   - Push branch to remote
   - Verify branch is up to date with `trunk`
2. **Write PR description**
   - Summarize changes clearly
   - Include context and motivation
   - List any breaking changes
   - Use the [PR template](../../.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) as a guide
   - If there's an issue from the issue tracker linked to the changes, add `Part of <issue-id>` to the PR description.
3. **Set up PR**
   - Create PR with descriptive title in the format `[Product Area]: [Description]`
   - Link related issues

## Rules

- If not already in a branch, prefer the autogenerated branch name from the issue tracker. If there are no issues associated with the requested changes, follow the [branch naming scheme](../../docs/git-workflow.md#branch-naming-scheme) conventions.
